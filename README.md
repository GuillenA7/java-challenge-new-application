# 🏦 Java Banking Challenge – Console Application

A simple interactive **banking system** built in Java as part of the **[ONE – Oracle Next Education](https://www.oracle.com/mx/education/oracle-next-education/) (Object-Oriented Java Track)** program.  
This project demonstrates fundamental Java programming concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, user input handling, and control flow using `switch` statements.

## 📋 Features

✅ Display client information  
✅ Interactive menu for account operations  
✅ Balance inquiry  
✅ Withdraw funds (with validation for insufficient balance)  
✅ Deposit funds (with validation for invalid amounts)  
✅ Currency formatting using `NumberFormat`  
✅ Loop-based control to keep the program running until user exits

- **Variables and Data Types** (`String`, `double`, `int`)  
- **User Input** with `Scanner`  
- **Conditional Statements** (`if`, `else`)  
- **Switch Control Structure** for multiple menu options  
- **Loops** (`while`) to maintain interactivity  
- **Input Validation** for deposits and withdrawals  
- **Console Output Formatting**  
- **Basic Error Handling**
